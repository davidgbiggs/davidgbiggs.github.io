commonjs and not ES imports/exports?\n\n  This module is used to alias `create-react-context` package, but drop the the actual implementation part\n  because Gatsby requires version of react that has

`babel-plugin-add-module-exports` is used ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports).\n  Which result in both `module.exports` and `exports.default` being set to same thing.\n\n  We don't use that babel plugin so we only have `exports.default`.\n\n  This cause problems in various 3rd party react components that rely on `module.exports` being set.\n  See
